# Markdown Cheat Sheet

## Headings

Use one or more hashtags `#` in the beginning of a line. Can go up to heading 6.

## Italics

Use either an asterisk `*` or an underscore `_` on both sides of the word or phrase.

Example: _italic_

## Strong

Use either double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` on both sides of the word or phrase.

Example: **Bold / Strong**

## Strikethrough

Use double tildes `~~` on both sides of the word or phrase.

Example: ~~strikethrough~~

## Horizontal Rule

Use either triple hifens `---` or triple underscores `___` on a single line. Example:

---

## Blockquote

Start the line using the `>` symbol. Example:

> This is a quote.
>
> > This is a quote inside a quote.

## Links

Include the text for a link inside brackets `[ ]` and the link itself inside parentheses `( )`. A title for the link can be included after de link in between double quotes `" "`.

Example: [Link to Google](https://www.google.com "Google")

## Unordered List

Start a line using the asterisk `*` symbol. Use a tab for nested items. Examples:

- Item 1
  - Nested item

## Ordered List

Start a line using a number and a dot `1.`. The order is automatically set considering the first item's number as the starting point of the list:

5. Item 1
6. Item 2

## Inline code block

Insert your code block in between backticks ` `` `. Example:

`<p>This is a paragraph<p>`

## Images

Similar to links, include the text for the image inside brackets `[ ]` and a link or location for the image itself inside parentheses `( )`. The only diference is the opening bracket `[` should be preceeded with a exclamation point `!` .

## Code Blocks

Insert your code block in between triple backticks ` ``` ``` `. You can also inform the language for highlighting. Example:

```javascript
let sumTwoNum = (num1, num2) => return num1 + num2
```

## Tables

Use bars `|` to separate the columns and `-` to separate the titles from the table data.
